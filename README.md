# Rpolyhedra

<!-- Polyhedra database scraped from publically available sources using R6 objects and 'rgl' visualizing capabilities. -->

This package is a curation made based on the poly package found on
<http://www.netlib.org/polyhedra/> ([Original Help
message](poly_original_help_message.html)), and the polyhedra database
found on <http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra>, both of which provide
polyhedra databases on its own format. As such, Rpolyhedra provides with
the following:

1.  A module to scrape the polyhedra for the different sources found
    with features for incremental correction of issues found and to be
    found in scraping process.
2.  A database of the scraped polyhedra.
3.  An R6 polyhedron representation with ‘rgl’ package visualizing
    capabilities.

# Preview

Through
[Rpolyhedraexplorer](https://qbotics.shinyapps.io/rpolyhedra-explorer/)
you can navigate the polyhedra database without actually installing R
environment.

# How to get started

``` r
install.packages("Rpolyhedra")
```

# How to get started (Development version)

Install the R package using the following commands on the R console:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/Rpolyhedra", build_opts = NULL)
```

# Loading the database

``` r
library(Rpolyhedra)
```

``` r
# if want to switch to fullDB in user filespace, it will ask you for downloading the full database to your home directory
switchToFullDatabase()
```

# A simple example of 5 regular polyhedra

To get started execute the following commands:

``` r
# 0.  Load libraries
library(knitr)
library(rgl)
# For forarding webgl output to knitr
knit_hooks$set(webgl = hook_webgl)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

``` r

# 1.  Obtain 5 regular solids
polyhedra.2.draw <- getAvailablePolyhedra(source = "netlib")
polyhedra.2.draw <- polyhedra.2.draw %>%
                        filter(scraped.name %in%
                            c("tetrahedron", "octahedron", "cube",
                               "icosahedron", "dodecahedron"))

# 2. Setup colors and scales
n <- nrow(polyhedra.2.draw)
polyhedron.colors <- rainbow(n)

polyhedron.scale <- 5
```

```` r
# For interactive RGL window
#```{r, render, webgl=TRUE}
# 3. open and setup RGL window

par3d(FOV = 1)
rgl.bg( sphere =FALSE, fogtype = "none", color=c("black"))
rgl.viewpoint(theta = 0, phi=0, zoom=0.8, fov=1)
# 4. for each polyhedron, setup rotation, position and render
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
  # Obtain polyhedron
  polyhedron.row <- polyhedra.2.draw[i,]
  polyhedron.name <- polyhedron.row$scraped.name
  polyhedron <- getPolyhedron(source = polyhedron.row$source, polyhedron.name)

  # Setup angles, position into transformationMatrix

  y.pos <- round(polyhedron.scale * cos(current.angle), 2)
  tm <- tm %*% translationMatrix(x.pos, y.pos, 0)

## sources

### netlib

Includes 142 polyhedra definitions. The PHD format was created to
describe the geometric polyhedron definitions derived mathematically by
Andrew Hume and by the Kaleido program of Zvi Har’El.

PHD files were generated using
[poly2](http://www.netlib.org/poly2/readme) library (no longer
maintained). Although the code is available, specific programming skills
are required to run it.

PHD files can be found in `extdata/www.netlib.org/polyhedra/index.html`

### dmccooey

Includes 767 polyhedra definitions. The [polyhedra
database](http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/) built by David Mccooey has an
open format which has been scraped to feed RPolyhedra database

dmccooey files can be found in `extdata/dmccooey.com/polyhedra/`

# Troubleshooting

## devtools

### Ubuntu

``` bash
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

### Windows

run end user CRAN version

### macOS brew

``` bash
brew install openssl
```

After, in R:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

## rgl

### Ubuntu

``` bash
sudo apt-get install r-cran-rgl
```
