Please ignore previous upload of release 0.4.4 as it doesn't include the sample database. I'm submitting again with the database (It generates automatically but we release a sample already included in the package).

There was some problems running check_rhub() with rgl (because the lack of screen in docker severs, I think), and in some environments it required string which is not a dependence of Rpolyhedra. check_win_devel() built ok in Windows.
